# The Canadian and NOS systems have many subtle differences.  Wallner
# gives the following recipe for converting Canadian data to the NOS
# system.
#
# NOS  NOS Can.  Modification of Canadian Constants
# Name No. Name  __________________________________
# SA   22  SA    Subtract 77.1° from the phase.
# MF   24  MF    Differences significant but not correctable.
# M1   18  NO1   Multiply amplitude of NO1 by 0.701.
# S1   17  S1    Add 154.3° to the phase, multiply amplitude by 0.699.
# OO1  15  OO1   Differences moderate but not correctable.
# R2   28  R2    Subtract 5.1° from the phase, multiply amplitude by 1.233.
# 2MK3 34  MO3   No modifications. Amplitude 0.9 to 1.14, phase ±4.2°.
#
# M1 versus NO1 is moot, as is 2MK3 versus MO3.  I've added
# constituents SA-IOS, MF-IOS, S1-IOS, OO1-IOS, and R2-IOS to
# approximate the others.  S1, SA, and R2 are adjusted as above in
# Canadian data via Wallner but not via LaPointe.  It's hard to say
# what data sources other than Canada might need the IOS constituents.
#
# MNS2 and EPS2 are nearly indistinguishable.
# KJ2 and ETA2 are nearly indistinguishable.
# MP1 and TAU1 are different in eq args and node factors.
# KP1 is significantly different from PHI1.
# RP1 and PSI1 differ by a 180 degree shift.
# TK1 and PI1 are different in eq args and node factors.
# KQ1 and UPS1 might ought to be indistinguishable, but lacking a
#   Darwin style formula for UPS1, it's hard to tell if it's the
#   Doodson approximation causing UPS1 to bounce around or if they
#   are meant to have slightly different eq args and node factors.
# M1 and NO1 are different because M1 has a curse on it (see below).
# BET1 is nearly indistinguishable from an unused constituent in SP 98
#   Table 2 (A19).
# THE1 and LambdaO1 differ by a 180 degree shift.
#
# Your mileage may vary.  The glossary of SP 98 asserts that KP1 and
# PHI1 are the same, that RP1 and PSI1 are the same, that TK1 and
# PI1 are the same, and that THE1 and LambdaO1 are the same.
#
# Aliases and equivalences
# ------------------------
#
# 3MSN10 is an alias for 3MNS10.
# 4MSN12 is an alias for 4MNS12.
# LAM2 and LABDA2 are aliases for LDA2.
# These have all been replaced by the latter names.
#
# H1 is an alias for ALP2; H2 is an alias for BET2.  We use H1 and H2
# here because that is what appears in the present batch of data.
#
# The NOS MSF is an alias for SM; see below.  We use the name MSF.
#
# Typographically, NU and V are interchangeable.
#
# Lots of aliases (not to mention lots of cases where a given
# constituent name is ambiguous) can be found in the IHO constituent
# list that is currently available at
# http://www.iho.shom.fr/COMMITTEES/TC/Constituents.pdf (it will be
# replicated in the congen and harmbase2 distributions shortly).  If
# two constituents have the same XDO (Extended Doodson Number), then
# they are identical.  If not, then they are different.
#
# Confusingly, the IHO list associates both MQ3 and NO3 with two
# different Doodson codes having all the same speeds:
#
#   MQ3   42.382 765   3 356 554   C XZA ZZY
#   NO3   42.382 765   3 356 554   C XZA ZZY
#   MQ3   42.382 765   3 356 555   C XZA ZZZ
#   NO3   42.382 765   3 356 555   C XZA ZZZ
#
# Deriving them according to the harmonic method used in the U.S. gives
# completely identical results for M2+Q1 or N2+O1.
#
# M1 / NO1
# --------
#
# NOS node factors for M1 contain a historical error that make them about
# 50% greater than they should be.  M1 amplitudes are correspondingly
# smaller to compensate.
#
# M1 has two formulas in SP 98 Table 2.  The first yields the correct
# speed for the constituent, while the second yields the correct
# equilibrium arguments (SP 98 p. 42).  The correct thing to do *here*
# is to use the second formula since congen automatically compensates
# the speed when the Q variable gets a nonzero multiplier.
# M1  Basic  1 -1 1 0 0 -90    1 -1 0 0 1 0     206
# Speed = 14.4966939
#
# Wallner writes:
#
#    In SP98, "Manual of Harmonic Analysis and Prediction of Tides" two
#    approaches are given for M1, which is a combination of two terms
#    in Darwin's theory, A16 and A23. (Why wasn't A71 included in the
#    combination? It is labelled (M1) in Table 2, its speed is half
#    that of M2 and its coefficient is larger than that of A16 or
#    A23!!)
#
#    V0 for the first  is T -s +h +p -90° and u is    -nu -Qu.
#    V0 for the second is T -s +h    -90° and u is xi -nu +Q.
#
#    The terms Qu and Q are such that the equilibrium arguments at the
#    start of the prediction interval are the same but the variable p
#    is absorbed in Q in the second method and held fixed for the
#    interval. Not only are there two approaches, alternate formulas
#    are given for some equations in which some elements are replaced
#    by their mean values. The tables in SP98 use these approximations.
#
# Canada uses NO1 = N2 - O1.  They don't use a constituent named M1.
#
# Regarding Japan's M1, Wallner wrote (1997):
#    The text with the Japanese constituents I got a little over two
#    year ago gives the argument of M1 as T - s + h - 90 as in the
#    second NOS definition.  The node factor f and phase u are
#    defined by:
#      f cos(u) = 2 * cos(p) + 0.4 cos(p-N)
#      f sin(u) =     sin(p) + 0.2 sin(p-N)
#    This gives essentially the NOS values.
#
# Upon further review in year 2000, Wallner wrote:
#    The Japanese u and f are reasonably close to the second SP98
#    formulation.  The Japanese constituent phases could be "corrected"
#    to work with first formulation in TIDES by subtracting p, but
#    since this is a variable that's not much help.  Considering it a
#    new constituent, or a different version of M1, would work
#    better.  The German M1 has the right speed, half that of M2, but
#    I'm not sure what u and f are for it.  The IHO data set has both
#    M1 and NO1, but again I'm not sure what their M1 is.  The French M1
#    appears to be NO1 exactly.  The Mexican data I have include another
#    undefined M1.
#
# Regarding Horn's publications, which have M1 = A71 but also NO1,
# Casement wrote:
#   I can't agree with his notation here.  What he calls NO1 is a
#   lunisolar tide and would be better called M1 - as it is by other
#   authors.  His M1 is in fact a shallow-water tide (= M3 - M2 +
#   180°) and would be better called MM1.
#
# The Dutch define the following constituents:
#   M1 = SP98 term M1 formula #1 (I have called this M1-DUTCH)
#   M1A = SP98 term A23
#   M1B = SP98 term A16
#   M1C = SP98 term A71
#   M1D = SP98 term M1 formula #2
# M1A, M1B, and M1D are not used in the data I have received.  M1C is.
# M1-DUTCH is used indirectly in the building of M7 (complete with
# exaggerated node factors).  The IOS formulation of M7 is 3.5 * M2!
#
# In summary, M1 is a minor constituent that doesn't deserve to be
# such an inconvenience.  Until someone complains, I am just going to
# use the NOS M1 for all data containing a constituent named M1 and
# hope for the best.  Future producers of harmonic constants are
# advised to abolish M1 and just use NO1.
#
# Other Problems
# --------------
#
# NOTE:  Like IOS, Casement's breakdowns of constituents use inverted
# phases for the constant angles relative to SP98.
#
# For OQ2, Horn uses O1 + Q1:
# OQ2  Compound  1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
# OQ2  Basic     2 -5 2 1 0 180    etc.
# but Canada uses a different formulation.
# Wallner wrote (in 1997):
#   First, a correction to the former correction of OQ2.  The TIDES
#   constituent assumed that this was compound tide O1+Q1 which is not
#   correct.  The Canadian definition should be used.  The Canadian
#   node argument and factor are difficult to convert to the TIDES
#   system and are set to 0 and 1.  The error should be no more than
#   about 20% of the constituent value.
#
# The Dutch use OQ2 = O1 + Q1.  I've called this OQ2-HORN.
#
# The MSF used by NOS is not derived using the formula in Table 2 but
# is instead calculated as a compound constituent (SP 98 p. 48).  This
# causes u to be nonzero.  Casement writes:
#   The NOS "MSf" is really SM0, a shallow-water tide = S2 - M2.  It
#   almost certainly does have a greater amplitude than the lunisolar
#   tide of the same frequency.
# This suggests that non-U.S. data might be using the "real" MSF.
#
# All Doodson constituents are approximate (we throw out the latitude-
# dependent bits).
#
# Mexican data contain A7 and LDA1.  Wallner writes:
#   The data set in the Anales del Instituto d Geofisica, v14 pp45-69
#   (1969) give 47 constituents for 23 stations. There is no LDA1 but
#   both A4 and A7 are included. These are presumably are those terms
#   in Table 2 of SP98, which is one of the references in the
#   article. My marginalia say A4 = MsM and A7 = Mtm.
# My guess would be that LDA1 = LambdaO1, but most data sets having LDA1
# also have THE1, which would cancel it out (they are nearly identical
# except for a 180 degree shift).  So at this point I'm just stripping
# LDA1 from the data.
#
# Problems with old harmonics.canadian and harmonics.japan
# --------------------------------------------------------
#
# harmonics.canadian was built by Jean-Pierre LaPointe at a time when
# all this was still voodoo to me.  harmonics.japan was mostly copied
# from harmonics.canadian by Toru Suzuki.  By the time I discovered
# some weird things that I needed to ask about, Jean-Pierre had
# dropped off the face of the Earth.
#
# The following features are not preserved in harmonics.world.
#
# Jean-Pierre used the NOS definitions for S1, SA, and R2 without making
# the adjustments mentioned above.  I've redirected SA, MF, S1, OO1, and
# R2 to the IOS versions for harmonics.canadian and assumed that the NOS
# versions were correct for harmonics.japan.
#
# NO1 in harmonics.canadian was N2 - O1, but with node factors from NOS M1.
#   NO1  Basic  1 -1 1 1 0 -90    0 -1 0 0 0 0     206
# I've replaced this by the normal NO1 formulation.
#
# harmonics.canadian used MP1 for TAU1.  I've replaced it with the
# Doodson TAU1 formulation and hope it's better that way.
#
# M1 in harmonics.japan was same as NO1 in harmonics.canadian except
# speed was changed to 14.4920521.  I've replaced this by the NOS M1.
#
# Both files used an OP2 whose argument was shifted by 180 degrees from
# O1 + P1.  I've used a normal OP2.
#
# Both files used an OQ2 that was O1 + Q1 with a 180 degree shift.
# I've replaced this with the Canadian (and IOS) form OQ2.
#
# Both files used an MKS2 that matched M2 + K2 - S2 in speed only.  The
# derivation of it remains a mystery.
